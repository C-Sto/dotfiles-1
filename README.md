# THIS IS A HOT MESS

This started as a pet project while setting up a new MBP, so you'll see a lot of macOS artifacts. The idea was to have a cohesive, distro agnostic, zsh theme to use now that Kali is going zsh with 2020.4

I've done my best to troubleshoot the installer and not be platform specific, but any PRs or advice/input would be more than appreciated.

## Installation

+ Pick a directory where you want to keep the repo files (I do ~/opt)
+ Clone repo
+ Run `install.sh`

This should create symlinks for all the repo files to their appropriate locations, install oh-my-zsh, and git clone any supporting repos needed for themes, addons, etc.

As always, YMMV, don't hold me responsible, blah blah blah
